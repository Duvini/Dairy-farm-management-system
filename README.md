# Dairy Farm Management System

üöÄ Excited to share that our team has successfully developed a comprehensive Dairy Farm Management System using the MERN stack, specifically tailored to address the critical needs of Sri Lankan dairy farmers! üåæüêÑ Our system includes robust modules for Finance Management, Veterinary Management, Employee Management, Grazing Management, Milking Management, Supply Chain Management, Sales Management, and Production Management. This all-in-one solution empowers farmers to optimize operations, improve productivity, and enhance profitability. üåü For instance, it tracks milk sales, manages breeding information, schedules grazing rotations, and monitors real-time inventory and production metrics, all while ensuring accurate financial records and facilitating effective employee task management. Given that Sri Lanka currently imports 60% of its dairy needs, our innovative system is poised to significantly boost local production, reduce dependency on imports, and drive economic growth in rural communities. üìäüí° Let's revolutionize the dairy industry together! #Agritech #DairyFarming #MERNstack #Innovation #Sustainability #SriLanka

## Veterinary Management Module

I had the opportunity to lead the development of the Veterinary Management module. My focus was on managing breeding information for individual cows, creating and maintaining detailed animal registration records, and facilitating health record-keeping for each cow, including illnesses, treatments, vaccinations, and deworming. This module ensures that farmers have all the necessary information to maintain herd health and optimize breeding strategies, contributing to overall farm efficiency and productivity. üêÑüíâ #VeterinaryManagement #HealthTech #DairyFarming #MERNstack
